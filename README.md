# ATC-Lite_Edit
***I do not entirely own the code, I started with open source code and made modifications to 
make my applicaitons work hopefully you can search less by my collection here.***
I used the open source code available for the Android app ATC-Lite to send data via bluetooth to my own custom applications. 
I do not own the code , I edited it a lot but it was created by Github user JuanLuisGonzalez. He did not post the code on 
Github but made it freely available via his amazing Android app named Arduino Total Control or ATC.
** Note I included bluetooth and temperature sensor code and a copy of the Adafruit MLX temp sensor library that you may find
useful for implementing your own IR temp sensing application.
** Note before the arduino bluetooth module "HC06" will connect you may need to activate it, so look on the forums for a how to. And the MLX IR temp sensors will need modification to the device address, I included code from the forum http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=54170.0 that I used to change my MLX adresses.
